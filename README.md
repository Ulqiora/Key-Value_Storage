# HashTable_and_B-tree
## This repository implemented data structures that store data as a key-value pair. This list includes:
- Hashtable
- BTree.
- AVL-tree.

## I was responsible for writing the Btree and the HashTable.It was also created the ability to create objects in the tree with the lifetime of the object.All classes have a common abstract class. The class that is responsible for dealing with lifetime objects is called ThreadsDel.
